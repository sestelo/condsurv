# condSURV 1.0.0 (2016-10-28)

  * modifications were introduced in the package 'condSURV' to account for multiple prior events. The current version of the package allows the user to obtain the conditional survival function where the conditional event is multi-dimensional.

  * the survKMW, survLDM and survPLDM functions were merged in a single function survCOND (with a 'method' argument).



# condSURV 2.0.0 (2016-12-05)

  * the survCOND and the survIPCW functions have been merged in just one (survCOND).

  * the survCOND function presents now a new argument formula similar to that in survfit function of the survival package. The cited formula object must be created, with the response on the left of a ′ ∼′ operator. The response must be a surv object which is obtained using the survCS function. Additionally, a single covariate (qualitative or quantita- tive) can be included in the right hand side of the formula allowing the estimation of survival probabilities conditionally on current or past covariate measures.

  * we have created a summary.surv function which can be used to to get the estimated values of the conditional probability at the desired values of “y” by means of the times argument.

  * the plot.surv function has been improved.





# condSURV 2.0.1 (2016-12-20)

  * the 'surv' class has been removed. Now, the main class is 'survCS'.

  * the 'conf' argument of the survCOND function is TRUE by default.





# condSURV 2.0.2 (2022-04-27)

  * it has been solved the note:  ``It is good practice to register native routines and to disable symbol search.""



# condSURV 2.0.2 (2022-11-14)

  * it has been solved the warning:  ``warning: invalid UTF-8 in comment [-Winvalid-utf8].""
